            <div class="intro">
                <p class="intro1">If you are unaware of CSS, it is a style sheet language. That means It allows you to add styling and let you present beautiful web pages. CSS allows you to add colours, fonts, borders to your web page, i.e. style your web page. To beautify html elements, we have to apply css to them. To apply css to any element we have to first select it. This article will discuss CSS selector, one of the core concepts of learning CSS, so let's begin.</p>

                <p class="intro2">The first requirement towards learning the style sheet language CSS is to get familiar with selectors and how they work? Selectors are what allows you to target specific HTML elements and apply the style to them. You can understand CSS selectors like this. Your task is to add font-size 12px to one of four paragraphs in a website, then how are you going to select that particular element? To apply font size to the first paras, we have to target that element. We do so with CSS selectors. The intention behind writing this blog is to teach those who are absolute beginners in CSS. You will surely learn about CSS selectors after that.
                </p>

                <p class="intro3">There are several type of selector in CSS.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="selector">1. ID Selector</li>
                    <li class="selector">2. Tag Selector</li>
                    <li class="selector">3. Class Selector</li>
                    <li class="selector">4. Universal selector</li>
                    <li class="selector">5. Attribute Selector</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="intro3">Before diving deep into how these selectors work. Can you answer this. how we are gonna select first p element from the HTML document. Don't feel overwhelmed with it. if you don't know the answer That's ok you will learn over time.</p>
                <div class="question">
<pre>
    <code>
        <strong class="comment">//First paragraph</strong>
        <span class="tag">&ltp</span> class='first_para'<span class="tag">&gt</span>Will It Matches&lt/p&gt
        
        <strong class="comment">//Second paragraph</strong>
        &ltp class='second_para'&gtWill It Matches&lt/p&gt

        <strong class="comment">//Third paragraph</strong>
        &ltp class='third_para'&gtWill It Matches&lt/p&gt

        <strong class="comment">//Fourth paragraph</strong>
        &ltp class='fourth_para'&gtWill It Matches&lt/p&gt
    </code>

        <span class="css">.first_para</span>{
            font-size: 16px;
        }
    </code>
</pre>

                </div>
                <p class="intro3">As you can see in css file that we selected first para with class selectors, whose class value is first_para and we apply a font-size property to it.

            <div class="colorresources">
                <h2 class="color-guide">How Selctors Work In CSS?</h2>
                <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <p class="colorpara">The above picture shows the syntax of css selectors. Step one start from HTML where we edefine various tags. Then in css file we first write selector name and it will search elements with that selector name in the document. Then we declare various css style declation which will be applied to the element matched by css selector.Now understand each Selctors one by one. Let's start with ID selector.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="colorresources">
                <h2 class="color-guide">ID Selector</h2>
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                <p class="syntax"><strong>#id_value { style properties }</strong></p>
                <p class="colorpara">To select an element with id we have to use # character before id attribute value in CSS.</p>
                <img src="/image/idselect.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <img src="/image/cssidselect.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <p class="colorpara">The CSS ID selector matches an element based on the value of the element’s id attribute. In order for the element to be selected, its id attribute must match exactly the value given in the selector.<br> ID selectors rank on top in terms of specificity. Meaning that they can override others selectors style and their style will be applied. So, use ID selectors wisely as it is hard to override them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="colorresources">
                <h2 class="color-guide">Tag Selector</h2>
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                <p class="syntax"><strong>element { style properties }</strong></p>
                <p class="colorpara">To select an element with tag name write tag name of particular element you want to select.</p>
                <img src="/image/tagselector.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <img src="/image/tagcss.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <p class="colorpara">The CSS tag selector selects all elements of the given type within a document. Tag selectors are at their most useful when changing properties that are unique to that HTML element. Like setting the list-style on a  list element. Also in chaining selector you can use tag selector.<br>
                One thing to keep in mind is that they are least specific. It’s means they can't override other selector styling, it's better to use class selector.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="colorresources">
                <h2 class="color-guide">Class Selector</h2>
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                <p class="syntax"><strong>.class_name { style properties }</strong></p>
                <p class="colorpara">To select a element with class you have to use . (period) character before class attribute value in CSS.</p>
                <img src="/image/classselect.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <img src="/image/classcss.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <p class="colorpara">The CSS class selector matches elements based on the contents of their class attribute. Class selectors are best way to select elements. They are probably the most useful and versatile selectors out there. In part because they are well supported in all browsers.<br>
                We can add multiple classes to a single element with a space separated. They rank well in specificity and I recommond you to use this selector.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="colorresources">
                <h2 class="color-guide">Universal Selector</h2>
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                <p class="syntax"><strong>* { style properties }</strong></p>
                <p class="colorpara">By writing  * character in CSS, we can select all the elements in CSS. This is called universal selector.</p>
                <img src="/image/uniselect.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <img src="/image/unicss.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <p class="colorpara">The CSS universal selector (*) matches elements of any type. Universal selectors are written with * character. Let's say we want to reomve padding from every element in HTML then this becomes useful.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="colorresources">
                <h2 class="color-guide">Attribute Selector</h2>
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                <p class="syntax"><strong>[attr=value] { style properties }</strong></p>
                <p class="colorpara">To select an element with attribute write attributename=attributevalue inside square brackett in CSS.</p>
                <img src="/image/atrselect.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <img src="/image/atrcss.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <p class="colorpara">The CSS attribute selector matches elements based on the presence or value of a given attribute. Attribute selector have same specificity as of class selector. They look little bit tricky to understand but useful though. But in some old version browser they are not supported.</p>
