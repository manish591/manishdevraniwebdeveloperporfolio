            <div class="intro">
                <p class="intro1">For those of you who don't know, CSS is a style sheet language. It allows you to transfer your ideas into a web format. CSS allows you to add colors, fonts, borders etc to your web page i.e. style your web page. CSS has been around for a very long time and has gone through major changes since it's first release. This article will discuss about css selector, one of the core concept of learning css, so let's begin.</p>

                <p class="intro2">The first and the biggest key to understanding CSS is understanding selectors. Selectors are what allows you to target specific HTML elements and apply style to them. This blog is for absolute beginners, You will surely learn about CSS selectors after that.
                </p>

                <p class="intro3">There are several type of selector in CSS.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="selector">1. ID Selector</li>
                    <li class="selector">2. Tag Selector</li>
                    <li class="selector">3. Class Selector</li>
                    <li class="selector">4. Universal selector</li>
                    <li class="selector">5. Attribute Selector</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <hr>

            <div class="colorresources">
                <h2 class="color-guide">ID Selector</h2>
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                <p class="syntax"><strong>#id_value { style properties }</strong></p>
                <p class="colorpara">To select an element with id we have to use # character before id attribute value in CSS.</p>
                <img src="/image/idselect.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <img src="/image/cssidselect.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <p class="colorpara">The CSS ID selector matches an element based on the value of the element’s id attribute. In order for the element to be selected, its id attribute must match exactly the value given in the selector.<br> ID selectors rank on top in terms of specificity. Meaning that they can override others selectors style and their style will be applied. So, use ID selectors wisely as it is hard to override them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="colorresources">
                <h2 class="color-guide">Tag Selector</h2>
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                <p class="syntax"><strong>element { style properties }</strong></p>
                <p class="colorpara">To select an element with tag name write tag name of particular element you want to select.</p>
                <img src="/image/tagselector.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <img src="/image/tagcss.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <p class="colorpara">The CSS tag selector selects all elements of the given type within a document. Tag selectors are at their most useful when changing properties that are unique to that HTML element. Like setting the list-style on a  list element. Also in chaining selector you can use tag selector.<br>
                One thing to keep in mind is that they are least specific. It’s means they can't override other selector styling, it's better to use class selector.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="colorresources">
                <h2 class="color-guide">Class Selector</h2>
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                <p class="syntax"><strong>.class_name { style properties }</strong></p>
                <p class="colorpara">To select a element with class you have to use . (period) character before class attribute value in CSS.</p>
                <img src="/image/classselect.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <img src="/image/classcss.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <p class="colorpara">The CSS class selector matches elements based on the contents of their class attribute. Class selectors are best way to select elements. They are probably the most useful and versatile selectors out there. In part because they are well supported in all browsers.<br>
                We can add multiple classes to a single element with a space separated. They rank well in specificity and I recommond you to use this selector.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="colorresources">
                <h2 class="color-guide">Universal Selector</h2>
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                <p class="syntax"><strong>* { style properties }</strong></p>
                <p class="colorpara">By writing  * character in CSS, we can select all the elements in CSS. This is called universal selector.</p>
                <img src="/image/uniselect.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <img src="/image/unicss.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <p class="colorpara">The CSS universal selector (*) matches elements of any type. Universal selectors are written with * character. Let's say we want to reomve padding from every element in HTML then this becomes useful.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="colorresources">
                <h2 class="color-guide">Attribute Selector</h2>
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                <p class="syntax"><strong>[attr=value] { style properties }</strong></p>
                <p class="colorpara">To select an element with attribute write attributename=attributevalue inside square brackett in CSS.</p>
                <img src="/image/atrselect.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <img src="/image/atrcss.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                <p class="colorpara">The CSS attribute selector matches elements based on the presence or value of a given attribute. Attribute selector have same specificity as of class selector. They look little bit tricky to understand but useful though. But in some old version browser they are not supported.</p>
