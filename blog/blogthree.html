            <div class="intro">
                <p class="intro1">Hello, I'm manish, a aspiring web developer. Have you ever use emmet. Probably yes! Emmet is powerful feature in vs code that give you starter code inside your HTML file. But, due to this we ignore the various tags above body tag. We forget about meta tag, title tag etc. These are the most important tag that you must know about. They can help improve traffic in your website. This we will learn later so stick around. First let us discuss about what is html?</p>

                <p class="intro2">If you are learning about web development then you have probably heard about HTML. HTML stands for hyper text markup language. It is called skeleton of the web page . It is used to layout the website. Hyper text means it is used to link to various documents in the world wide web thus make a connection in the web page. HTML uses various markup tags to layout HTML document. Like head tag, heading tag, paragraph tag etc. You can see the basic HTML document that we are referring below:</p>

                <div class="resourceimg">
                    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--29kWVP4B--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_720,q_auto,w_1280/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/zbaylzi3lb2jpixr1epr.png" alt="" class="resourceimg">
                </div>

                <p class="intro2">As you can see that we have to main section inside html tag that is  head and body tag. Content inside body tag is visible inside the browser but content inside the head tag is not visible inside the browser. But head tag tells a lot about page and it is really helpful. It includes title, liking to css and javascript, favicons etc. If you utilize these tags effectively then it can be really helpful in many ways. They improve search engine optimization. In this blog post we will cover these tags and see how they can impact your website. We will learn why yo should include them in your website. Be curious and explore about these topics in much details. So let's begin.</p>

                <h2 class="color-guide">Before We Begin</h2>
                <p class="colorpara">You can also see that above the html tag we have Doctype HTML written. let's first discuss what that means.
                    Doctype html tells Instruct document that which version to use in this document. The above tag tells browser to use HTML 5 in the document. If you didn't write this in your document it will get confused. It thinks ou are writing code from 90's. It can still parse code but also introduced bugs in your code sometimes.
                    
                    we can  also specifies the language of the document with this code block in the bottom. It tells browser which language to expect when rendering document.
