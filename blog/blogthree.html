                <p class="intro2">As you can see that we have to main section inside html tag that is  head and body tag. Content inside body tag is visible inside the browser but content inside the head tag is not visible inside the browser. But head tag tells a lot about page and it is really helpful.

                <p class="colorpara">You can also see that above the html tag we have Doctype HTML and lang attribute. Let us explore them first.
                    <br><strong>DOCTYPE HTML</strong> tells Instruct document that which version to use in this document. The above tag tells browser to use HTML 5 in the document. If you didn't write this in your document it will get confused. It can't identify whhich version of code to expect. It can still parse code but also introduced bugs in your code sometimes.
                    <br><strong>lang="en"</strong> attribute used to identify the language of text content on the web. en here means to expect english language. There are other various code available.<br> Let's discuss what's inside head of the html document.</h3>

               <p class="aboutcoolors">This tag is used to describe title of the whole document. Don't confuse it with h1 heading tag. H1 is present on the web page itself but title tag content present on tab section.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="iconresources">
                <h2 class="icons">Linking to css and javascript</h2>
                <p class="iconpara">Having a separate CSS and Javscript file is must. This can make your code more beautiful and human readable. You can link your external CSS and Javscript file inside head using link and script tags respectively.
                 <br> For Linking CSS you have to use link tag with href and rel attribute.
                 <br> For Linking to Javscript you have to use script tag with source attribute.   
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="illustrationsresources">
                <h2 class="illustration">Meta tags</h2>
                <p class="illustrationpara">Meta data is the data that describes the data of document. It won't show on web page but do a lot behind the scenes. It is useful for search engine optimization. It is used to describe content, author, description keyword related to the page. Let's explore them.</p>

                <h3 class="undraw">charset attribute of meta tag</h3>
