                <p class="intro1">Hi, I'm a programmer, and not a designer. Over the years I've been building websites, a lot of my clients ask about how to improve their design. That's why I decided to write this blog post. In my opinion, the details can make or break a website. However, most designers are usually not interested in the fine details. That's where I come in. As you can see from the title this article is targeted at programmers/developers who are trying to improve their website's design without hiring a designer.</p>

                <h1 class="color-guide">Color Resources</h1>
                <p class="colorpara">Finding the right color for your website can be hard. Then, you asked 10 different people to tell you the best choice. Out of those 10 different people, 3 or 4 gave you the same advice. Now what do you do? Do you listen to them? Which websites should I use? What about books and tools? That is why we created this blog post - to provide a place where you can find answers to all of these questions. In this article, we will talk about some great resources and tools that will help with choosing the right colors.</p>

                <h1 class="stockimages">Stock Images</h1>
                <p class="stockimagepara">Another important aspect in web design is the images used. Good (or bad) images can make a wonderful website look great or terrible. I use stock images to increase the beauty of my work, but I don’t know any good site where you can download free stock images. Also, most of the sites are really tricky and force you to register just to download one image. That’s why I have decided to make this post about best stock image sources.</p>
                <h2 class="pexels">Pexels</h2>
                <p class="aboutpexels">pexels is great stock image website which provide you with high quality images for free. More than 8000+ photos in their library and they’re adding new photos every day. The key element of taking a photo from online is licenece. With pexels you don't have to worry about licencing freely use these in your design.</p>
